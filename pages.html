		<p>Radioactive Nightmare: Project  Chernobyl
26 April 1986. A manmade mistake would lead to the biggest ecological disaster which would make the name "Chernobyl" shiver for many generations.
Serghei Ilici, a scientist, had the fortune to survive the explosion while many of colleagues died in vain.
Thirty years later, Serghei receives a message from a relative to meet him in what used to be his home, Pripyat - the heart of the Exclusion Zone.
He goes there just to discover the severe effects of the radiation. The entire land is an undead limbo and he must escape from there.
We proudly present the survival-horror video game which will define the 8th generation of gaming. Coming soon on your PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Wii U and Microsoft Windows.
It features  over 5 hours of gameplay to explore the whole Chernobyl Exclusion zone, a downright creepy and deep story,
an ambiental soundtrack which gives you the chillies and great graphics that push the consoles to their limits.
It was first mentioned in 1997 and it was developed for PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Later, a Sega Dreamcast was in development before our previous company got bankrupt in 2004.
The project has been revived and we hope that it will materialize in what we expected from the beginning.

			<p>City Of Fortune , 
Bucharest, Romania. It is November 1999. A new millenium full of prosperity and hope is coming. The biggest Gypsy mafia family in the city lost their leader after a surprise attack led by gangsters from Vaslui. 
One possible succesor, Johnny T, has recently been released from prison after 10 years just to see his clan's decline. He swears revenge on those who had murdered their boss and tries to reclaim his status in the city before the turn of the new millenium.
DarkBlocks Studios presents an open-world adventure video game promised as a Grand Theft Auto V-like redux which include dozens of new features such as QuickTime events and real time events.
Coming soon on your PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Originally started as a mission-based shooter game on PlayStation 2 in 2011 it became an open-world adventure game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The latter had been cancelled due to Microsoft's indie developer policy. Th PlayStation 3 version has been left unfinished. As the PS4 arrived on market, the PS3 has been considered unviable.
However a prototype still exists in the archive.         </p>

			WELCOME TO OUR FIRST PAGE OF THE REALM OF NEXT-GEN GAMING
			.HERE , THROUGH OUR WEBSITE , WE WILL SEE A LIFE-TIME WORK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE GAMES THAT ARE NOW  REVEALED TO THE PUBLIC . PLEASE , ENJOY!!!
		</h1>
		<p>
	All this project have started as a foolish idea during the highschool to begin making games that can reach undeniable 
	performances running on computers with limited hardware.
	One day , while we we're coding during the class, one of our
	cofounders has came up with an idea while he was playing with reading files binary. That idea was to creat an engine that could read constantly from computer's memory. So ,for the past 4 years, we've been working at this day and night, which in the end it became our succesfull technology. The engine is available now on 7th and 8th generation consoles plus Dream Cast and PlayStation 2.
